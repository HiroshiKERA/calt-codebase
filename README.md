# CALT codebase

The CALT codebase provides a template for generating arithmetic and symbolic computation instances and training Transformer models using the [CALT (Computer ALgebra with Transformer) library](https://github.com/HiroshiKERA/calt).

While CALT can be installed via `pip`, the following is the simplest setup your experiment with all dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HiroshiKERA/calt-codebase.git
cd calt-codebase
conda env create -f environment.yml 
```

The [documentation of the CALT codebase](https://hiroshikera.github.io/calt-codebase/) provides a quickstart guide and tips for organizing your own projects. For detailed usage of the CALT library, please refer to the [CALT documentation](https://hiroshikera.github.io/calt/).
